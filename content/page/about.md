# About

This is the homepage of Gijs Koot. If you want to reach me, send me a DM via Twitter or LinkedIn.

I am interested in data mining, with applications in quantified self and media. Ultimately, I want to understand and support people with data-driven innovations.

In my spare time I like playing music, reading up on developments in technology and climbing.
