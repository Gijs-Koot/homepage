I've just replaced my old homepage by what you see right now. This is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) based website, completely out-of-the-box with an added  theme that you can find [here](http://crimsonray.github.io/slender/). There is an [about](/about) page, and you can find links to other platforms through the icons on the main page.
